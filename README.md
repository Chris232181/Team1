# Project Description/Outline:
Our project is to understand if IPO activity is correlated to economic performance. We'll examine relationships between IPOs and their correlation to performance of the S&P500 (e.g., trading volume/prices/volatility, correlation), as well as correlation to consumer sentiment on home buying during the same timeframe.

# Research Questions to Answer:
1. How many IPOs occurred during a specific time period?
 - First graph: Bar chart - IPOs, by year, broken down by filed/priced/withdrawn (insights: busiest year, % of total IPOs that were actually priced)
 - Second graph: Line graph - total priced IPOs by month, with lines as each year (insights: busiest month)
 
2. What was the performance of the S&P500 over the same period of time?

 
3. What is the correlation of the IPOs to the performance of the S&P500 during the same time period?
 
4. Which were the largest IPOs? How much would you have made if you invested in the top 2-3?

5. What was the correlation of S&P 500 performance to consumer sentiment?
