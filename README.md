* Project Description/Outline:
Our project is to understand how IPOs influence market performance. We'll examine relationships between IPOs and their correlation to performance of the S&P500 (e.g., trading volume/prices/volatility, correlation), as well as correlation to consumer sentiment on home buying during the same timeframe.
* Research Questions to Answer:
How many IPOs occurred during a specific time period?
# First graph: Bar chart - IPOs, by year, broken down by filed/priced/withdrawn (insights: busiest year, % of total IPOs that were actually priced)
# Second graph: Line graph - total priced IPOs by month, with lines as each year (insights: busiest month)
What was the performance of the S&P500 over the same period of time?
# First graph: Line graph - y-axis = index price, x-axis = year
What is the correlation of the IPOs to the performance of the S&P500 during the same time period?
# First graph: Bar chart/Line  - y-axis = S&P 500 index price, x-axis = year, 2 lines - 1 for S&P and 1 for IPOs (insights: most profitable month, least profitable month)
# Second graph: withdrawals compared to S&P500 performance - where x axis is year y axis is 
Which were the largest IPOs? How much would you have made if you invested in the top 2-3?
# First graph: scatter plot?

Think about removing these:
What was consumer sentiment toward home buying during this same time period?

What was the correlation of S&P 500 performance to consumer sentiment toward home buying?
