* Project Description/Outline:
Our project is to understand how IPOs influence market performance. We'll examine relationships between IPOs and their correlation to performance of the S&P500 (e.g., trading volume/prices/volatility, correlation), as well as correlation to consumer sentiment on home buying during the same timeframe.
* Research Questions to Answer:
How many IPOs occurred during a specific time period?
What was the performance of the S&P500 over the same period of time?
What is the correlation of the IPOs to the performance of the S&P500 during the same time period?
What was the most profitable month and least profitable month of market performance?
What was consumer sentiment toward home buying during this same time period?
What was the correlation of S&P 500 performance to consumer sentiment toward home buying?
